# MedianProject
A collection of median algorithms

#### Unfinished and Currently on Backburner

The C++ Standard Library has a very efficient n-th element algorithm. However, it does not address the issue of 
read-only n-th element algorithms, that is, n-th element algorithms that do not modify the data. Providing these
for C++ was the original intent of this project. The project has progressed quite nicely, but it had to be put on 
the backburner in the summer of 2015 and will likely stay there for a long time, unless someone else picks it up.
