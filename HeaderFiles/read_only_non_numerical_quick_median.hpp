/*
 * Non-modifying median algorithm in average N * log(N) time. This is appropriate
 * for situations where the data must not be modified, and there are not enough
 * resources to make a copy of the data.
 *
 * The algorithm works for numerical and non-numerical data, that is, elements
 * do not have to support arithmetic operations such as calculating a mean (midpoint)
 * of two elements. For numerical data, there is a better algorithm (coming soon).
 *
 * Arguments are begin and end iterators to the data. These do not  have to be better
 * than forward iterators. The return value is a pair of iterators. For an uneven
 * number of elements, both iterators point to the median. For an even number of
 * elements, they point to the left and right endpoint of the median interval.
 *
 * There are two versions of this algorithm. The first is for all kinds of data,
 * including sorted data. Performance improves if the iterators are bidirectional
 * rather than just forward, and even more if they are random access.
 *
 * The second version is for the special situation where the data is essentially the
 * result of a random walk, that is, there is no reason to assume that sorted data
 * is particularly likely to occur. In this case, the second version tends to perform
 * noticeably better than the first. This is true in particular for iterators that are
 * not random access. The performance of the second version does not vary significantly
 * for different iterator categories.
 *
 * A brief description of the algorithm can be found at lines 457 - 475 of the implementation
 * file "read_only_non_numerical_quick_median_detail.hpp". There will soon be an article
 * on my personal web site with more details about background, context, existing work, etc.

 * Function read_only_non_numerical_quick_median
 * ==============================================
 *
 * Non-modifying median algorithm for non-numerical data in average N * log(N) time.
 *
 * For best results, use random access iterators. Bidirectional iterators will work
 * well, but performance may suffer. Forward iterators will cause noticeable
 * performance degradation. In the special case where the data is essentially the
 * result of a random walk (sorted data is not particularly likely), the performance
 * hit caused by non-random-access iterators can be avoided by using the alternate
 * version read_only_non_numerical_quick_median_random_data.

 *
 * Non-modifying median algorithm for non-numerical data in average N * log(N) time.
 * This version of the algorithm improves performance if the data is essentially the
 * result of a random walk, that is, it has no particular likelihood of being sorted.
 * This is true in particular when the iterators used are no better than forward
 * iterators.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: For sorted data, the performance of this version of the algorithm will degrade
 * to N^2. Use this algorithm only if your data is essentially random, that is, has little or
 * no tendency to be sorted. If sorted data is likely, use read_only_non_numerical_quick_median
 * instead, regardless of the iterator category.
